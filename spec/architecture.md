# MUXL Architecture

This document describes the relationship between MUXL's format representations and how deterministic canonicalization enables format-independent content addressing and provenance verification.

## Core Principle

Deterministic canonicalization decouples transport, storage, and signing. The same source frames can exist in multiple container formats, all derivable from each other, because the canonicalization rules are fully deterministic. Content bytes (encoded video/audio samples) never change — only the container structure around them.

## Format Representations

```
source frames
  ├─ Hang CMAF (per-frame moof+mdat)            → MoQ transport, minimal latency
  ├─ MUXL segment (per-track moof+mdat ×N)      → canonical byte sequence, signing unit
  ├─ MUXL archive fMP4 (ftyp+moov+segments)     → appendable storage, playback
  └─ flat MP4 (ftyp+mdat+moov)                  → export, universal playback
```

### Hang CMAF — Transport Format

Each encoded frame is wrapped in a minimal `moof+mdat` pair (`tfhd` + `tfdt` + payload). One frame per fragment, one GoP per MoQ group. Codec configuration lives out-of-band in a MoQ catalog using WebCodecs types (`VideoDecoderConfig`, `AudioDecoderConfig`).

This is the lowest-latency representation. No sample tables, no init segment, no moov. Optimized for real-time delivery over MoQ/QUIC with group-level partial reliability (entire GoPs are dropped during congestion rather than individual frames).

MUXL does not define this format — it is defined by the [Hang specification](https://doc.moq.dev/concept/layer/hang). MUXL only needs to be able to consume it.

### MUXL Segment — Canonical Byte Sequence

A MUXL segment represents one GoP of content. Each track has its own moof+mdat pair. This is the canonical byte sequence that content hashes and signatures are computed over.

```
moof(track 1) + mdat(track 1)      ← video frames for this GoP
moof(track 2) + mdat(track 2)      ← audio packets for this GoP
moof(track 3) + mdat(track 3)      ← additional tracks
```

Key properties:

- **Per-track moof+mdat pairs**: each track is independently hashable without parsing
- **Blindly concatenatable**: multiple segments can be appended by simple byte concatenation
- **Init data is out-of-band**: track initialization metadata (codec config, timescales) is not part of the segment; it comes from the archive file header or an external source (e.g., S2PA manifest)
- **Deterministic**: given the same source frames, any MUXL implementation produces identical segment bytes

Track ordering within a segment: tracks are ordered by track_id (ascending).

Segmentation rule: each segment begins at a video sync sample (keyframe). Audio samples are grouped with the video GoP they temporally overlap. This rule is deterministic — given the same samples with the same timestamps, the segment boundaries are always identical.

### MUXL Archive fMP4 — Storage Format

For storage, the archive prepends an init segment (ftyp + moov with empty sample tables) to concatenated MUXL segments:

```
ftyp + moov (init, empty sample tables)
moof+mdat + moof+mdat ...              ← GoP 1 (per-track pairs)
moof+mdat + moof+mdat ...              ← GoP 2
...
```

This is a valid fMP4 file — any player can open it. New GoPs are appended without modifying existing data (crash-safe, no finalization step for 24-hour livestreams).

The init segment is stable as long as the track configuration doesn't change. When codec parameters change (e.g., resolution switch), a new init segment is needed (see Open Questions).

The init segment is deterministic: given the same track configuration, any MUXL implementation produces identical init bytes.

### Flat MP4 — Export Format

Standard MP4 with a single `moov` containing complete sample tables and a single `mdat` containing all sample data. Layout: `ftyp`, `mdat`, `moov`.

Maximally compatible with players, editors, and media tools. Generated on demand from MUXL archive fMP4 or segments + init data.

Can be deterministically converted back to MUXL segments by re-segmenting at keyframe boundaries. This is what enables signature verification from a flat MP4 export.

See `canonical-form.md` for detailed box-level specification.

## Round-Trip Properties

```
Hang CMAF ──canonicalize──► MUXL segments ──prepend init──► archive fMP4
                                │                                │
                                │                           flatten ↓
                                │                            flat MP4
                                │                                │
                                ◄────────── re-segment ──────────┘
```

- **Hang CMAF → MUXL segments**: Accumulate per-frame fragments into GoP-sized segments. Construct per-track moof+mdat pairs. Apply canonical ordering and metadata normalization.

- **MUXL segments → archive fMP4**: Derive init segment from track metadata. Prepend to concatenated segments.

- **archive fMP4 → flat MP4** (`flatten`): Consolidate all moof/trun tables into moov sample tables. Concatenate all mdat payloads. Write single moov at end.

- **flat MP4 → MUXL segments** (`segment`): Walk moov sample tables to find keyframe boundaries (stss). Slice samples into GoP-sized segments. Construct per-track moof+mdat pairs. Each segment's content bytes are identical to the original.

## Signing Pipeline

MUXL defines what bytes are canonical. S2PA (or any signing system) defines how to sign them. MUXL has no dependency on S2PA.

For a live stream with S2PA:

```
encoder → frames → MoQ transport (Hang CMAF, per-frame)
                        │
                   [real-time viewers see frames immediately]
                        │
                   accumulate GoP
                        │
                   build MUXL segment (per-track moof+mdat)
                        │
                   hash each track's moof+mdat independently
                        │
                   S2PA sign (per-track hashes → signature)
                        │
                   append segment to archive fMP4
                        │
                   publish updated S2PA manifest
                        │
                   [verifiers can now check this GoP]
```

Key properties:

- **Signing is not on the hot path**: frames transmit immediately; the signer runs ~1 GoP behind
- **Zero additional latency** for viewers who don't need real-time verification
- **~1 GoP latency** (typically 1-2 seconds) for inline verification
- **Retroactive verification** is always possible from the archive + manifest

### Per-Track Signing Model

Each track within a GoP segment is hashed independently:

```
GoP 1:
  track 1 (video): moof+mdat bytes → hash_v1
  track 2 (audio): moof+mdat bytes → hash_a1
  track 3 (audio): moof+mdat bytes → hash_a2
```

This supports:

- **Subset verification**: verify only the video track without touching audio
- **Track independence**: drop or replace a track without invalidating the others
- **Multi-track streams**: multiple synced video and audio tracks

## Dynamic Stream Changes

Mobile WebRTC/WHIP sources may change resolution or orientation mid-stream (phone rotation, camera switch). This produces new H.264 SPS/PPS (or AV1 sequence headers) at keyframe boundaries.

In the pipeline:

1. Resolution change always aligns with a keyframe (codec requirement)
2. Keyframe starts a new GoP → new MUXL segment
3. New segment references updated codec parameters via the init data
4. In flat MP4, `stsd` accumulates multiple entries; `stsc` tracks the transitions

Because segment boundaries align with codec parameter changes, each segment is self-consistent — it references exactly one set of codec parameters per track.
