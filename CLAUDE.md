# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**muxl** is a Rust tool for deterministic MP4 file canonicalization, part of the MUXL specification. It's like [DRISL](https://dasl.ing/drisl.html) but for MP4 files. The goal is to produce byte-identical MP4 output from the same logical content, enabling stable content-addressed identifiers (CIDs) for video.

This is a companion to **S2PA** (Simple Standard for Provenance and Authenticity), which extends C2PA with decentralized identity (DIDs, secp256k1/ES256K signing) for video provenance without certificate authorities. Together, S2PA and MUXL bring video to DASL and the AT Protocol ecosystem.

## Build Commands

```bash
cargo build          # build
cargo run -- <file>  # run against an MP4 file (e.g. cargo run -- samples/file.mp4)
cargo check          # type-check without building
```

## Repo Structure

- `src/main.rs` — Rust binary (reading + canonicalization)
- `spec/` — canonical form specification (one section per box type)
- `scripts/remux.sh` — remuxes an MP4 through ffmpeg, ffmpeg+faststart, gstreamer, MP4Box
- `scripts/mp4dump.py` — machine-readable MP4 box tree dump (supports `--flat` for diffing)
- `web/compare.html` — visual side-by-side comparison of mp4dump output
- `samples/` — test MP4 fixtures
- `Dockerfile` — builds a container with all four muxers for comparison

## Architecture

Library (`src/lib.rs`) + CLI (`src/main.rs`). Uses a vendored fork of `mp4-rust` at `crates/mp4` (git subtree). Targets Rust/WASM.

**MUXL segment** (canonical byte sequence): one track's moof+mdat pairs for one GoP. Per-track, independently hashable, blindly concatenatable. Track init metadata is out-of-band (archive file header or external source).

**MUXL archive fMP4** (storage): `ftyp + moov (init) + [track 1 segments] + [track 2 segments] + ...` — valid fMP4 file, per-track byte-range addressable for HLS.

Public functions:
- **`catalog_from_mp4()`**: extract track configuration metadata from MP4/fMP4
- **`build_init_segment()`**: catalog → canonical ftyp+moov init segment
- **`fragment_fmp4()`**: fMP4 → per-frame Hang CMAF fragments (streaming, Read only)
- **`segment_fmp4()`**: fMP4 → MUXL segments (streaming, Read only)
- **`Segmenter`**: push-based segmenter for WASM/async (feed chunks, get events)

**Key design constraints**:
- Livestreaming ingest via WebRTC/WHIP — segments arrive as 1-second chunks
- Must handle dynamic resolution/orientation changes (new SPS/PPS at keyframes)
- 24-hour streams — no finalization step, fMP4 is always valid
- Per-track content hashes must survive flat MP4 round-trip
- Multiple synced video/audio tracks; individual tracks independently hashable

## Key Details

- Rust edition 2024
- Depends on a vendored `mp4` crate at `crates/mp4` (git subtree from alfg/mp4-rust)
- `samples/file.mp4` is a test fixture

## Comparison Tooling

Generate remuxed variants and compare their box-level structure:

```bash
# Build the comparison container (has ffmpeg, gstreamer, MP4Box)
docker build -t muxl-compare .

# Remux a file through all four muxers → output/ directory
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/work muxl-compare /work/scripts/remux.sh /work/samples/file.mp4

# Dump flat box structure for diffing
python3 scripts/mp4dump.py --flat samples/output/ffmpeg-faststart.mp4

# Diff two muxer outputs
diff <(python3 scripts/mp4dump.py --flat output/ffmpeg-faststart.mp4) \
     <(python3 scripts/mp4dump.py --flat output/gstreamer.mp4)

# Visual comparison: open web/compare.html in a browser
```

## Canonicalization Workflow

Development follows an incremental, box-by-box process:

1. **Observe discrepancies** — use `mp4dump.py --flat` diffs across muxer outputs to see how a specific box type varies
2. **Document the canonical choice** — add/update the relevant section in `spec/canonical-form.md` with the chosen canonical form and rationale
3. **Implement in Rust** — add the canonicalization logic in `canonicalize()` (or equivalent), with a comment referencing the spec section
4. **Verify** — confirm the output matches the canonical form for test fixtures
5. **Commit** — commit spec + implementation together, one box at a time

All choices are provisional — expect to revisit after real-world playback testing across browsers, mobile players, and hardware decoders.
